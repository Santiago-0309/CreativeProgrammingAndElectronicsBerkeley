COURSE DESCRIPTION

In this course, we will explore the creative and expressive nature of
computational approaches to art and design. We will approach writing code like
creative writing, to tell a story or to express our feelings. We will build
machines like creating artworks, to embrace failure and to adventure into the
unknown.

Over the course of the semester, you will learn how to write code and build
electronics for a series of art machine projects, including robotic
instruments, kinetic sculptures, and interactive installations. We will
be using the Arduino, an open-source library and integrated
development environment (IDE) built for makers—students, hobbyists, artists,
programmers, and professionals; and Processing, another
creative software, as a tool for augmenting the physical world with digital
information.

Along the way, we will also look at a variety of strange, whimsical, and
beautiful works created by historical and contemporary artists and
technologists, and we will re-think computation from a poetic, provocative
perspective.

PREREQUISITES

This course has no prerequisites. It pairs well with DES INV 22: Prototyping &
Fabrication I, but the two courses can be taken in either sequence, or
individually.

ATTENDANCE

This course contains a great deal of technical material and creative
information, and because our process of experimentation and critique is
collaborative, attendance is mandatory. You are allowed two absences for the
semester without penalty (except critique days and design showcase); – each
additional absence will result zero credit for the missed studio.  To receive
an additional excused absence, you must ask in advance, and receive an
acknowledgment from the instructor. Excusable absences include family
emergencies, job interviews, and presenting at a conference. To receive credit
for attendance, you must arrive on time. No late assignments will be accepted.
For any absence, it is the student’s responsibility to inquire with classmates
for notes, make up any exercises completed in class, and to complete impending
assignments.

ZOOM

This course will be delivered online using Zoom. If no one in class
objects, meetings will be recorded so that students can review material
at their leisure. 

During meetings, I expect your cameras to be turned on.
Your facial expressions are important feedback for me to know whether
you are understanding the material. Furthermore, sharing our
faces is a sign of mutual respect.
If there are extenuating circumstances that prevent you from 
turning on your camera, you must state your reason to me in an email 
in advance, and receive an acknowledgment from me.

Students who leave their cameras off without permission
will be marked as absent.

SPRING SHOWCASE 

Apart from our regular class meetings, participation in the 
virtual showcase on Friday, August 14th 10-4pm
is required. Our class will have an hour 
during which each student will present their project. Attendance is mandatory.

ASSISTANCE

If you are not familiar with this material, you might find it
frustrating at first. Finding problems in programs and electronics circuits
is like trying to solve a detective mystery by following clues, 
but the program or circuit will give you clues only when you ask
very simple questions to which you will get very literal answers. 
Computers and electronics only understand what you tell them, 
not what you mean. But don't feel bad, we all started the same way.
Even professional programmers spend more time trying to fix their 
own problems than writing the programs in the first place.
The only reason I'm good at finding your problems is that I've 
made them all myself, many times.

Fortunately, there are many ways to get help:

1. We have set up an online community for students and faculty (TBA) 
and this should be the first place to ask a question 
because one of your fellow students may have an answer before the
professor or GSI responds
1. We are fortunate to have a GSI (TBA)
1. Your professor welcomes questions by email at any time, although
answers may not be immediate depending on the time.

DISTRACTIONS

Using a cellphone or laptop in class for purposes other than classwork is not
tolerated. If you are caught 3 times doing so your grade for the course will
be an F, regardless of your work.

HOMEWORK

Homework in this class is meant to be exploratory, a way to expand on the
experiences and ideas in class. I encourage wide-ranging interpretation of
assignments: consider ways that you can complete the project that are
creatively and intellectually exciting for you. Don't limit yourself to
fulfilling the basic requirements. (That said, some assignments will have
restrictions on them – these kinds of constraints can spur creativity, so
embrace them!)

You should expect the material to be rigorous and thorough. Unlike tests,
projects require considerable engagement and thoughtful work on your own, and
I want to see you working each week on projects. All assignments are due by
the start of class and should be turned in on your Github repository, which
will be explained and created on the first day of class.
Details of each
project will be available on the class page 
including details about how to turn in specific projects,
what’s to be included, etc.

REQUIRED MATERIALS

Before class starts, prepare **all** of these materials:

- Electronics kit
- Laptop on which you have permission to install software
- Laptop charger 
- A notebook or sketchbook for taking notes and drawing ideas, even if you
	take notes on your laptop
- A clear, well-lit space to work

Required and suggested readings will be provided as PDFs on the course site –
there is no required textbook.

GRADING

The goal of all assignments is for you to think and make. Everyone comes from
a different background and experience, so I’ll be looking for improvement,
curiosity, engagement, and a willingness to experiment. A grading rubric will
be provided with each assignment to help you understand what is expected and
how you did.

To get a C (an average grade) you should:
- Put time into your projects each week
- Complete everything on time
- Participate in critiques and discussions

For a B or an A, you should additionally:
- Take risks and try things enthusiastically
- Be an active and unsolicited participant in critiques and discussions
- Take assignments beyond their minimum requirements

Final grades will be determined as follows:
Class participation: 20%
Homework: 30%
Midterm project: 20%
Final project: 30%

PRONOUNS

As this course includes lots of interaction between students, it’s important
for us to create an environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes
the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronouns and chosen
name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or
pronouns, please inform me of the necessary change.
